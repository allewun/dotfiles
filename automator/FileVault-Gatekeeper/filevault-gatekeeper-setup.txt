1. From main account, create new admin account (the gatekeeper)
2. Log out, go to gatekeeper account
3. Remove main user account from the filevault list of users (`fdesetup remove -user <main>`)
4. Compile keys.m, create Automator app with auto-logout.applescript
5. System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items > Add the script

Now when starting up computer, FileVault will go thru gatekeeper, gatekeeper will log itself out (unless CMD is held down)
